                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    My group worked on the Toronto Environmental Alliance web site. It is a small non profit
                    organizationabout keeping Toronto clean and green, relying on donations and help from environmentally conscience people. We aim to revamp the site's navigation, layout and colours of the website to be more user friendly as well as adding features from our research to bring in, and retain more people for
                    donations and volunteering.
                </p>
                <h2>Role & Responsibilites</h2>
                <p>
                    We were a team of 3 people. I was the UI designer and content creator of this project. Other
                    positions consists of UX designer, project coordinator, and design coordinator.
                </p>
                <h2>Timeline & Scope</h2>
                <p>
                    We had 3 weeks to complete this project
                </p>
                <h2>Phase 1: User Research</h2>
                <p>
                    We created a proto persona to see what type of research objective questions to ask in the user interviews and create a google survey which gave us the resources to move on to the next phase.
                </p>
                <h2>Phase 2: Definition & Synthesis</h2>
                <p>
                    With the user research created from our research we got the necessary information to formulise an affinity diagram to organize the information so we could create an empathy map and a user persona. With our user persona created, we wrote a user insight and build a problem statement.
                </p>
                <h2>Phase 3: Ideation</h2>
                <p>
                    Using the problem statement we brainstormed for feasable and effective features to include in our redesign of the site with the prioritization matrix and define a value proposition statement. We created a user scenerio and user journey map based our problem statement. We started the user flow analysis and created a user flow diagram while we started the wireframes for the prototyping phase.
                </p>
                <h2>Phase 4: Prototyping (low-hi)</h2>
                <p>
                    A wireframe from a few pages are created while we conduct the usablility heuristics analysis and competitor analysis for the user flow. We went back and forth between the testing phase and kept iterating the webpage. A mood board and style guide is created along with the card sorting and sitemap during this process to give the website a more welcoming and warm feel and a more cohesive and smoother navigation experience for the user.
                </p>
                <h2>Phase 5: User Testing + Outcomes</h2>
                <p>
                    We utilised the heuristic usability testing, and the 5 second testing for our prototype
                </p>
                <h2>Phase 6: Conclusion + Future Opportunities</h2>
                <p>
                    By giving the benefactors as much options possible for them to get as involved as they prefer, you can turn a “limited-Amount” patron into “Selfless and Highly Involved” Advocates. Simplicity is Key keep the information output concise and organized and consistent in your information output. If you want your users to come back, there has to be something for them to come back to.
